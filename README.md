# LinearPowerSupply
This is a folder containing my journey in design and construction of a linear bench power supply.

V1 - LTSpice simulation. Crude version to test main circuit.
LinearPSv1_MatheusGolz - corresponding files for EasyEDA (PCB file + schematic).

V2 - LTSpice simulation. Active current limiting added.
